## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV 4.5 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4 or higher
- NumPy 1.19 or higher
- Matplotlib 3.3 or higher

## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
- Run `python face_detection.py` to run the main script
- You can change the input source by modifying the `source` variable in the script
- You can also adjust the parameters such as `confidence_threshold`, `nms_threshold`, and `model_path` in the script

## Results

The script will display the input image or video with bounding boxes and confidence scores around the detected faces. It will also save the output image or video in the `output` folder.
