# Face_Detection_Project

This is a project that uses computer vision and deep learning to detect faces in images and videos. Face detection is a useful technology that has many applications in various domains, such as security, social media, education, healthcare, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV 4.5 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4 or higher
- NumPy 1.19 or higher
- Matplotlib 3.3 or higher

## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
- Run `python face_detection.py` to run the main script
- You can change the input source by modifying the `source` variable in the script
- You can also adjust the parameters such as `confidence_threshold`, `nms_threshold`, and `model_path` in the script

## Results

The script will display the input image or video with bounding boxes and confidence scores around the detected faces. It will also save the output image or video in the `output` folder.
